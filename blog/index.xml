      <description>This is going to be the first post published on this new iteration of my website. Fun fact, I had initially thought I&amp;rsquo;d be using Pika for my new homepage, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend checking it out if you want a no-friction blogging tool! However, if I was going to start writing more, I wanted to do so with complete control of where my content was hosted and how it was rendered&amp;ndash; which meant going all-in on using Hugo (with the lovely Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog theme, which is inspired by another minimalist indie blogging platform, Bear Blog).</description>
