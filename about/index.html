<p>Welcome to Vaida&rsquo;s personal website!</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently working out what my identity is in the present moment and in the present world, and how I can engage with the things I like in ways that make me happy. So, here&rsquo;s a list of things I like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media - whether games, music, TV, or film, as long as it makes me feel something</li>
<li>The outside world - this blog is an attempt to simplify my digital presence and separate myself from the feed, so I can spend more time outside meeting up with friends and doing things that make me feel alive</li>
<li>Kindness and empathy baby!!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="work">Work</h2>
<p>I enjoy intentional work on projects that enable other people, whether helping them be creative or by providing a well-designed tool. I like to think about how people think and how to make working together easy, so that we can make great things together in better ways.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in user experience design, product design, production &amp; design especially of games, and storytelling in all domains.</p>
<p>üèôÔ∏è By day, I‚Äôm a product manager and design lead at <a href="https://www.researchspace.com/">RSpace</a>, an open-source research data management platform. I‚Äôm on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaida-plankyt%C4%97-878281106">LinkedIn</a> and reachable at <a href="mailto:vaida@researchspace.com">vaida@researchspace.com</a>.</p>
<p>üåÉ By night, I‚Äôm a UI/UX designer on a few <a href="https://www.strangescaffold.com/">Strange Scaffold</a> games. I&rsquo;m currently working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>. I‚Äôve worked on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2632930/Life_Eater/">Life Eater</a>, which NME has listed as <a href="https://www.nme.com/features/the-best-games-of-2024-so-far-3767675">one of the best games of 2024 so far</a>. Also Markiplier played it and seemed to like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also made a bunch of microgrames, they&rsquo;re on <a href="https://vaidap.itch.io/">itch.io</a>.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;ll compile a portfolio of the various talks/things/etc I&rsquo;ve done throughout the years, at some point!</p>
