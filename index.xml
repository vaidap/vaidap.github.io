      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been enjoying this month!
Music Perverts - Ethel Cain made me feel really present in my body and in the moment I was listening to it, and I&amp;rsquo;m grateful for that. It&amp;rsquo;s inspiring me to make whatever I want to and be super unapologetic about it. I&amp;rsquo;m also looking forward to listening to her NTS.live residency episodes. Check out her Tumblr to learn more about her inspiration and process.</description>

      <description>This is going to be the first post published on this new iteration of my website. Fun fact, I had initially thought I&amp;rsquo;d be using Pika for my new homepage, and I&amp;rsquo;d recommend checking it out if you want a no-friction blogging tool! However, if I was going to start writing more, I wanted to do so with complete control of where my content was hosted and how it was rendered&amp;ndash; which meant going all-in on using Hugo (with the lovely Hugo ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog theme, which is inspired by another minimalist indie blogging platform, Bear Blog).</description>

      <description>About Welcome to Vaida&amp;rsquo;s personal website!
Personal I&amp;rsquo;m currently working out what my identity is in the present moment and in the present world, and how I can engage with the things I like in ways that make me happy. So, here&amp;rsquo;s a list of things I like:
Media - whether games, music, TV, or film, as long as it makes me feel something The outside world - this blog is an attempt to simplify my digital presence and separate myself from the feed, so I can spend more time outside meeting up with friends and doing things that make me feel alive Kindness and empathy baby!</description>
