# Portfolio

I've freelanced as a video game UI/UX designer for [Strange Scaffold](https://www.strangescaffold.com/) on the following projects:

* UI Designer on [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3229100/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Tactical_Takedown/) (portfolio page to be added ðŸš§)
* [UI/UX Designer on Life Eater](/portfolio/life-eater/)

<!-- {% for project in collections.portfolio %}
* <a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.data.title }}</a>
{% endfor %} -->

I've also made a bunch of microgrames, they're on [itch.io](https://vaidap.itch.io/).
